                <h2>Pergamon Museum</h2>
                <p>
                    The Pergamon Museum was designed by Alfred Messel; its
                    construction was overseen by Ludwig Hoffmann and lasted
                    twenty years, from 1910 to 1930. A smaller building
                    initially stood on the same site for a just few years before
                    being torn down. It housed the important excavation finds
                    unearthed by the Berlin museums, such as the frieze panels
                    from the <span>Pergamon Altar</span>, reclaimed from the
                    earth in digs that lasted from 1878 to 1886. Inadequate
                    foundations, however, soon resulted in the building becoming
                    structurally unstable and it had to be demolished.

                <h2>Neues Museum</h2>
                <p>
                    The opening of <strong>the Neues Museum</strong> marked a
                    key chapter in the history of 19th-century art, museum
                    design, and technology. Designed by Friedrich August Stueler
                    and built from 1843 to 1855, the building
                    <strong>suffered severe damage during World War II</strong>,
                    after which it was left as an abandoned bombsite. Emergency
                    measures to secure the structure were only taken in the
                    1980s.
