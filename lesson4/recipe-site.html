            <h2>Fufu</h2>

            <h3>Overview</h3>

            <p>
                Fufu is very difficult to make, a process that starts by
                pounding cassava and unripe plantains together with a big wooden
                pole and mashing them while adding water. As it needs to be
                vigorously stirred, it usually takes two people to make it - one
                pounding it, and the other moving it around between the
                pounding.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once the mixture is smooth, it gets shaped into small balls that
                are then placed in a stew or soup with meat. Similar to the
                Tanzanian ugali, an indentation is made in the ball, used for
                scooping up the sauce, with fufu acting as a spoon.

            <ul>
                <li>Ogbono Soup</li>
                <li>Yassa</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>300 g (10 1/2 oz) un-ripened plantain</li>
                <li>460 g (16 oz) cassava</li>
                <li>350-450 ml water for blending</li>
                <li>50 ml (3 tbsp + 1 tsp) water for steaming</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Preparation / Steps</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    First, peel the plantain and cut it into cubes. Peel and
                    scrape the cassava, de-string it and also cut into cubes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Next, place the cassava and plantain into the blender. Add
                    water: for now, use 350 ml if you want fufu to be firmer, or
                    450 ml if you prefer it softer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Turn the blender on and process the ingredients into a
                    smooth paste.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Next, heat the paste in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir
                    constantly with a wooden spatula for 8 to 10 minutes to
                    remove any lumps.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Now, add the remaining 50 ml of water to the mixture. Reduce
                    the heat to the lowest setting, cover with a lid and steam
                    for another 8 to 10 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After that, increase the heat to medium setting and stir.
                    The fufu might look too soft, but it will become firmer as
                    it cools down.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Transfer the fufu into a bowl and sprinkle one teaspoon of
                    water on the surface to prevent forming a film. Let it cool
                    completely.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Shape fufu into a ball and serve with soup or stew of your
                    choice.
                </li>
